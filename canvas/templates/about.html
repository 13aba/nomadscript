        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At Nomad Script, we are dedicated to preserving and revitalizing the traditional Mongolian script 
        through interactive learning and modern technology. Our platform serves as both an educational tool for 
        beginners and a collaborative space for fluent users to contribute to a growing dataset of handwritten 
        Mongolian letters.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Our near term plan is to increase the number of supported languages to reach even wider audience, and add
            interactive events such as leaderboard for contributors and more engaging video lessons for the beginners.
            Our broader vision is to remain an open-source project while expanding with additional tools, such as an API 
            for direct database access.
